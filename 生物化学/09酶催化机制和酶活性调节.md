# 酶的活性位点

+   The active site(活性部位)of the enzyme is the place where the substrate binds and at which catalysis occurs 
+   The active site binds the substrate(底物),forming an enzyme-substrate(ES)complex.

## Characteristics of enzyme active site

+   The active site takes up a small part (1-2%) of the total volume of the enzyme.
+   It is the most important part as it directly catalyzes the chemical reaction.
+   It <font color=ee0000>usually consists of three</font> to four amino acids, while other amino acids within the protein are required to maintain the tertiary structure of the enzymes.

### Amino acid residues in the enzyme active site

+   The active site is <font color=ee0000>3-dimensional</font> and is generally found in a <font color=ee0000>pocket, crevice or cleft</font> in the enzyme <font color=ee0000>tertiary structure</font>, requiring that the substrates diffuse in and the products diffuse out.
+   The amino acid residues of the active site may be <font color=ee0000>far apart in the orimary structure</font> owing to the folding required for tertiary structure.

+   The specificity of binding depends on the precisely defined arrangement of atoms in an active site.
+   Models for active site of enzyme:

+   Active site contains functional groups(-OH,NH2,-cOOH,etc.)
+   Substrates are bound in the active site cleft by noncovalent interactions
