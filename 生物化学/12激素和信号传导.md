# Hormone and Signal Transduction 激素和信号传导

Biosignaling is Fundamental to Life

Cells constantly receive and act on signals from the internal and external environments

## Classification of hormone

## Characteristics of hormone

+   Hormone(激素), a chemical substance, synthesized in small amounts by an endocrine tissue(内分泌组织) that is carried in the blood(体液) to another tissue or diffuses to a nearby cell, where it acts as a messenger to regulate the function of the target tissue or organ 
+   Hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues

## Six basic mechanisms for signal transduction

### Signal Transduction

+   The process that a signal which represents information is detected by specific receptors and converted to a cellular response is called signal transduction(信号转导).
+   Signal transduction always involves a chemical process.
+   Even though the number of different biological signaling is large,organisms use just a few evolutionary conserved mechanisms to detect extracellular(胞外) signals and transduce them into intracellular(胞内) changes.

### Basic signaling pathway

### General features of signal transduction

#### Specificity(特异性) of signal transduction

![image-20211028142202759](image/image-20211028142202759.png)

Signal molecule fits binding site on its complementary receptor; other signals do not fit.

#### Amplification(级联放大性) of signal transduction

When enzymes activate enzymes, the number of affected molecules increases geometrically in an enzyme cascade.

#### Desensitization(脱敏)of signal transduction

Receptor activation triggers a feedback circuit that shuts off the receptor or removes it from the cell surface.

#### Integration(整合,相互作用) of signal transduction

Organisms are able to receive multiple signals and produce a unified response appropriate to their needs.

When two signals have opposite effects on a metabolic characteristic such as the concentration of a second messenger X, or the membrane potential Vo, the regulatory outcome m results from the integrated input from both receptors.

## Six basic mechanisms for signal transduction (信号转导的六种基本机制)

### Gated ion channels (门控离子通道)

+   lon channels not continuously open
    +   静息状态下关闭
+   Can switch between open and closed state by changing conformation
    通过改变构型实现开关
+   Conformation change regulated by conditions inside and outside cell
    通过胞内外条件调节构型转变

#### The Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体) is a ligand-gated ion channels

+   Acetylcholine binds to an acetylcholine receptor.
+   This forces a conformational change in the receptor, causing its ion channel to open.
+   Allows $Na^{+}$, $Ca^{2+}$, and $K^+$ to pass through its channel with equal ease, but other

### Receptor enzymes (酶联受体)

![image-20211028144002271](image/image-20211028144002271.png)

Commonly, the receptor enzyme is a protein kinase(激酶) that phosphorylates Tyr residues in specific target proteins.
