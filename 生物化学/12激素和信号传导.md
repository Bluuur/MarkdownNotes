# Hormone and Signal Transduction 激素和信号传导

Biosignaling is Fundamental to Life

Cells constantly receive and act on signals from the internal and external environments

## Classification of hormone

## Characteristics of hormone

+   Hormone(激素), a chemical substance, synthesized in small amounts by an endocrine tissue(内分泌组织) that is carried in the blood(体液) to another tissue or diffuses to a nearby cell, where it acts as a messenger to regulate the function of the target tissue or organ 
+   Hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues

## Six basic mechanisms for signal transduction

### Signal Transduction

+   The process that a signal which represents information is detected by specific receptors and converted to a cellular response is called signal transduction(信号转导).
+   Signal transduction always involves a chemical process.
+   Even though the number of different biological signaling is large,organisms use just a few evolutionary conserved mechanisms to detect extracellular(胞外) signals and transduce them into intracellular(胞内) changes.
