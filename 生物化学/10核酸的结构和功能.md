### Classification of nucleic acid

A nucleic acid(核酸)is a polymer in which the monomer units are nucleotides(核苷酸).There are two types of nucleic acids:

1.   **D**eoxyribo**n**ucleic **a**cid (DNA) (脱氧核糖核酸)
2.   **R**ibo**n**ucleic **a**cid (RNA) (核糖核酸)

#### Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (脱氧核糖核酸)

+   A helical double-stranded nucleic acid that is crucial for containing the genetic information for cell growth, division, and function.
+   The amino acid sequence of every protein in a cell, and the nucleotide sequence of every RNA, is specified by a nucleotide sequence in the cells DNA.
+   A segment of a DNA molecule that contains the information required for the synthesis of a functional biological product, whether protein or RNA, is referred to as a gene.
+   The storage and transmission of biological information are the only known functions of DNA.

#### Ribonucleic acid (RNA) (核糖核酸)

A polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.

##### Three main types of RNA are involved in protein synthesis 

+   Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (信使RNA) are intermediaries,carrying information for the synthesis of a protein from one or a few genes to a ribosome.
+   Transfer RNAS (tRNAs) (转移RNA) are adapter molecules that faithfully translate the information in mRNA into a specific sequence of amino acids.
+   Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (核糖体RNA) are components of ribosomes,the complexes that carry out the synthesis of proteins.

### Distribution of nucleic acid

+   DNA
    +   In eukaryotes 
        +   Most DNAs are located in the nucleoli and chromosomes in the nucleus 
        +   A small fraction of the total DNA is present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cytoplasm.
    +   In prokaryotes and viruses 
        +   DNA is found in the cytoplasm.
+   RNA
    +   In eukaryotes 
        +   RNA is found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.

        +   it is found in the cytoplasm.

## Chemical components of nucleic acid

Nucleic acid (核酸) can be hydrolyzed into nucleotides (核苷酸) by nucleases. The hydrolyzed nucleic acid has equal quantity of base (碱基), pentose (戊糖) and phosphate (磷酸).

+   The two polynucleotide chain are spirally or helically twisted, whichgives it a twisted ladder-like look.
+   Antiparallel direction, i.e. one in5'-3' and other in 3'-5' direction.
+   The diameter of ds-stranded DNA helix is 20 A.
+   The distance between the two nucleotides or internuclear distance is 3.4 A. The length of DNA helix is 34 À after a full turn and it possesses 10 base pairs per turn.

##### Replication of DNA as suggested by Watson and Crick

![image-20211014153158217](image/image-20211014153158217.png)

The preexisting or "parent" strands become separated, and each is the template for biosynthesis of a complementary "daughter" strand (in pink)

##### Three possible models for DNA Replication	

![image-20211014153221065](image/image-20211014153221065.png)

#### DNA can occur in different three-dimensional forms

##### Structural variation in DNA

+   The conformation of a nucleotide in DNA is affected by rotation about seven different bonds. Six of the bonds rotate freely. The limited rotation about bond 4 gives rise to ring pucker.
+   For purine bases in nucleotides, only two conformations with respect to the attached ribose units are sterically permitted, anti or syn.
    Pyrimidines occur in the anti conformation.
