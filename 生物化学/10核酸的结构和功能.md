### Classification of nucleic acid

A nucleic acid(核酸)is a polymer in which the monomer units are nucleotides(核苷酸).There are two types of nucleic acids:

1.   **D**eoxyribo**n**ucleic **a**cid (DNA) (脱氧核糖核酸)
2.   **R**ibo**n**ucleic **a**cid (RNA) (核糖核酸)

#### Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (脱氧核糖核酸)

+   A helical double-stranded nucleic acid that is crucial for containing the genetic information for cell growth, division, and function.
+   The amino acid sequence of every protein in a cell, and the nucleotide sequence of every RNA, is specified by a nucleotide sequence in the cells DNA.
+   A segment of a DNA molecule that contains the information required for the synthesis of a functional biological product, whether protein or RNA, is referred to as a gene.
+   The storage and transmission of biological information are the only known functions of DNA.

#### Ribonucleic acid (RNA) (核糖核酸)

A polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.

##### Three main types of RNA are involved in protein synthesis 

+   Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (信使RNA) are intermediaries,carrying information for the synthesis of a protein from one or a few genes to a ribosome.
+   Transfer RNAS (tRNAs) (转移RNA) are adapter molecules that faithfully translate the information in mRNA into a specific sequence of amino acids.
+   Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (核糖体RNA) are components of ribosomes,the complexes that carry out the synthesis of proteins.

    +   In eukaryotes 
        +   Most DNAs are located in the nucleoli and chromosomes in the nucleus 
        +   A small fraction of the total DNA is present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cytoplasm.

## Chemical components of nucleic acid

Nucleic acid (核酸) can be hydrolyzed into nucleotides (核苷酸) by nucleases. The hydrolyzed nucleic acid has equal quantity of base (碱基), pentose (戊糖) and phosphate (磷酸).

### Primary Structure-Sequence

+   Primary structure of DNA is formed by the covalent backbone consisting of deoxyribonucleotides linked to each other by phosphodiester bonds, is simply the sequence of nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction.

![image-20211014150745861](image/image-20211014150745861.png)

### Secondary Structure-Double Helix

James Watson and Francis Crick postulated the secondary structure of DNA in 1953 in their double helical model.

#### Watson-Crick model for the structure of DNA

##### Physical Properties of DNA

+   The two polynucleotide chain are spirally or helically twisted, whichgives it a twisted ladder-like look.
+   Antiparallel direction, i.e. one in5'-3' and other in 3'-5' direction.
+   The diameter of ds-stranded DNA helix is 20 A.
+   The distance between the two nucleotides or internuclear distance is 3.4 A. The length of DNA helix is 34 À after a full turn and it possesses 10 base pairs per turn.

##### Replication of DNA as suggested by Watson and Crick

![image-20211014153158217](image/image-20211014153158217.png)

The preexisting or "parent" strands become separated, and each is the template for biosynthesis of a complementary "daughter" strand (in pink)

##### Three possible models for DNA Replication	

![image-20211014153221065](image/image-20211014153221065.png)

#### DNA can occur in different three-dimensional forms

##### Structural variation in DNA

+   The conformation of a nucleotide in DNA is affected by rotation about seven different bonds. Six of the bonds rotate freely. The limited rotation about bond 4 gives rise to ring pucker.
+   For purine bases in nucleotides, only two conformations with respect to the attached ribose units are sterically permitted, anti or syn.
    Pyrimidines occur in the anti conformation.

+   <font color = ee0000>A mirror repeat (镜像重复)</font>, on the other hand，has a symmetric sequence within each strand.

![image-20211014153910409](image/image-20211014153910409.png)

+   The self-complementarity within each strand confers the potential to form <font color = ee0000>hairpin(发卡)</font> or <font color=ee0000>cruciform(十字)</font> (cross-shaped) structures

![image-20211018080857718](image/image-20211018080857718.png)

### Circular and superhelical DNA

+   Circular DNA is DNA that forms a closed loop and has no ends. Examples include
+   ![image-20211018083035297](image/image-20211018083035297.png)

    +   Negative when the double helix is in left handed coil

    +   >   拓扑异构

![image-20211018083252241](image/image-20211018083252241.png)

+   All organisms store their DNA as negatively supercoiled because it 

    +   Decreases storage space 

    +   Allows for opening of the helix for replication transcription, etc.

+   <font color=ee0000>DNA supercoiling(DNA超螺旋)</font> is important for <font color= ee0000>DNA packaging</font> within all cells. Because the length of DNA can be of thousands of times that of a cells, packaging this material into the cell or nucleus(in Eukaryotes) is a difficult feat 
+   Supercoiling of DNA <font color=ee0000>reduces the space</font> and allows for much more DNA to be packaged

+   They change the linking number by changing the number of writhes 
+   The change the linking number by breaking one or both strands of the dna molecule, winding them tighter or looser, then rejoining the ends 
+   They work only on topologically constrained DNA molecules because only topologically constrained DNA molecules can have writhe

---

+   Type I topoisomerase(拓扑异构酶l)

    +   Breaks only one strand of the dNA

    +   No ATP is required for its function

        +   >   需要能量, 不需要ATP

+   20-200 adenine nucleotides at 3 end
+   A un-translated sequence
+   Related with mRNa degradation that begins with poly a tail shortening
+   Associate with poly a tail binding proteins for protection

### Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (转移RNA)

tRNA serves as an amino acid carrier to transport AA for protein synthesis

#### tRNA structure 

+   The overall structure is a cloveleaf, reversed L-shape structure 
+   There are three loops and four stems 
+   The 3-D structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds of local intrachain base pairs on these stems

#### Two key sites of tRNA

+   A tRNA molecule has an amino acid attachment site and a template-recognition site, bridging DNA and protein
+   The template-recognition site is a sequence of three bases called the anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon

#### Functional role of tRNA in protein synthesis

+   tRNA modifications both promote and inhibit aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)-mediated aminoacylation.
+   Elongation factor(EF) recognizes and delivers aminoacylated tRNA
    (aa-tRNA) to the A site (A) of the ribosome.
+   The codon-anticodon interaction at the A site is facilitated by tRNA modifications.

#### tRNA contains a high portion of unusual bases tRNA Modifications

#### Functions of tRNA modifications

+   These modifications can cause large rearrangements as well as local fine-tuning in the 3D structure of a tRNA.
+   Modifications ensure correct folding, efficient translation, and can serve as identity elements for recognition by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. 
+   Modifications can adapt tRNAs to different environmental conditions such as temperature.
+   Modified bases can also be of great importance for applications in synthetic biology to fine-tune the structure of aptamers and riboswitches or for the improvement of orthogonal suppressor tRNA systems in the introduction of non-natural amino acids into proteins.

### Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (核糖体RNA)

+   rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes during protein synthesis and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids during protein synthesis.
+   rRNA assembles with numerous ribosomal proteins to form ribosomes.
+   Ribosomes associate with mRNA to form a place for protein synthesis.
