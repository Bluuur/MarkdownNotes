# Hydrolysis of nucleic acid（核酸水解）

+   The nucleic acid can be broken down into the free bases, phosphoric acid, and(deoxy) ribose during hydrolysis.![image-20211021141834310](image/image-20211021141834310.png)

+   The glycosidic bonds(糖苷键) and phosphodiester bond(磷酸二酯键) in nucleic acid can be broken down by acids(酸), alkali(碱), enzymes(酶).

+   Effect of acid(酸)
    +   RNA and DNA are insoluble in cold acid. DNA is more sensitive to acid hydrolysis than RNA.
    +   In a neutral pH range, pH 5 to 9, DNA molecules are quite stable.
        However, if the pH becomes too acidic or alkaline,DNA molecules are prone to destabilization.
    +   At pH 5 or lower, DNA is liable to depurination(去嘌呤化) (i.e. the loss of purine bases from DNA).The phosphodiester bonds of DNA break which causes the base pairs of DNA to break off.
        +   Depurination in DNA is a chemical reaction of purine deoxyribonucleosides，deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine，in which the β-N-glycosidic bond（糖苷键）is hydrolytically cleaved releasing a nucleic base，adenine or guanine.

        +   The electrophilic attack of acid on N7 gives rise to depurination by hydrolysis

    +   Treatment with 1N HCI at 60 ℃ for 10 minutes will not hydrolyze RNA but can depurinate DNA. This is used in Feulgen staining procedure and makes it DNA specific staining.
    +   At pH<1, however, both DNA and RNA break down into the free bases, phosphoric acid, and(deoxy) ribose.
+   Effect of alkali（碱）
    +   At pH 9 or higher，negatively-charged ions remove hydrogen ions from the base pairs of DNA，thereby breaking the hydrogen bonds between and causing the DNA strands to denature. While less damaging in comparison to acidic pH levels，high alkaline pH levels can still result in depurination.
    +   RNA is hydrolyzed rapidly under alkaline conditions，but DNA is not. RNA can be easily hydrolyzed at alkali pH as it contains 2'-OH

+   Effect of enzymes(酶)
    +   Nucleases(核酸酶) are a class of enzymes called hydrolases(水解酶)
    +   Break nucleic acids into smaller subunits called nucleotides by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bonds(磷酸二酯键) present between them

    +   Classification of Nucleases 
    +   Based on substrate preference,they can be grouped into DNases(脱氧核糖核酸酶) and RNases(核糖核酸酶).
    +   Based on their site of action along the nucleic acid strand,nucleases can be grouped into exonucleases(外切核酸酶) and endonucleases(内切核酸酶)![image-20211021142803663](image/image-20211021142803663.png)
    +   Restriction enzyme(Restriction endonuclease 限制性内切酶),is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as **restriction sites**.
    +   Production of blunt ends and sticky ends.![image-20211021142843060](image/image-20211021142843060.png)

## Restriction endonucleases are very useful in recombinant DNA technology

+   Recombinant DNA technology has been exploited in order to provide selective improvements in various specialties that include crop agriculture, pharmaceutics, gene therapy, vaccine design and bioremediation.
+   The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, identify, map and sequence genes, and to determine their function

## Acid-base properties of the nucleic acid (核酸酸碱性质)

+   Nucleic acid bases(碱基), nucleosides(核苷) and nucleotides(核苷酸)can all be dissociated. Under certain conditions,zwitterion(兼性离子) can be formed,which is an amphoteric electrolyte(两性电解质) with an isoelectric point(等电点).

## Ultraviolet absorption properties of the nucleic acid（核酸紫外吸收性质）

![image-20211021143902377](image/image-20211021143902377.png)

+   Nucleic acids absorb ultraviolet(UV) light due to **conjugated double bonds**(共轭双键) in their purine and pyrimidine rings; the sugar-phosphate backbone does not contribute to absorption.

+   The wavelength of **maximum absorption for both DNA and RNA is 260nm.**
