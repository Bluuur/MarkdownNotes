# Hydrolysis of nucleic acid（核酸水解）

+   The nucleic acid can be broken down into the free bases, phosphoric acid, and(deoxy) ribose during hydrolysis.![image-20211021141834310](image/image-20211021141834310.png)

+   The glycosidic bonds(糖苷键) and phosphodiester bond(磷酸二酯键) in nucleic acid can be broken down by acids(酸), alkali(碱), enzymes(酶).

+   Effect of acid(酸)
    +   RNA and DNA are insoluble in cold acid. DNA is more sensitive to acid hydrolysis than RNA.
    +   In a neutral pH range, pH 5 to 9, DNA molecules are quite stable.
        However, if the pH becomes too acidic or alkaline,DNA molecules are prone to destabilization.
    +   At pH 5 or lower, DNA is liable to depurination(去嘌呤化) (i.e. the loss of purine bases from DNA).The phosphodiester bonds of DNA break which causes the base pairs of DNA to break off.
        +   Depurination in DNA is a chemical reaction of purine deoxyribonucleosides，deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine，in which the β-N-glycosidic bond（糖苷键）is hydrolytically cleaved releasing a nucleic base，adenine or guanine.

        +   The electrophilic attack of acid on N7 gives rise to depurination by hydrolysis

    +   Treatment with 1N HCI at 60 ℃ for 10 minutes will not hydrolyze RNA but can depurinate DNA. This is used in Feulgen staining procedure and makes it DNA specific staining.
    +   At pH<1, however, both DNA and RNA break down into the free bases, phosphoric acid, and(deoxy) ribose.
+   Effect of alkali（碱）
    +   At pH 9 or higher，negatively-charged ions remove hydrogen ions from the base pairs of DNA，thereby breaking the hydrogen bonds between and causing the DNA strands to denature. While less damaging in comparison to acidic pH levels，high alkaline pH levels can still result in depurination.
    +   RNA is hydrolyzed rapidly under alkaline conditions，but DNA is not. RNA can be easily hydrolyzed at alkali pH as it contains 2'-OH

+   Effect of enzymes(酶)
    +   Nucleases(核酸酶) are a class of enzymes called hydrolases(水解酶)
    +   Break nucleic acids into smaller subunits called nucleotides by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bonds(磷酸二酯键) present between them.
