> Green Book is a 2018 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Peter Farrelly. Set in 1962, the film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga, who served as Shirley's driver and bodyguard. The film was written by Farrelly, Brian Hayes Currie and Vallelonga's son, Nick Vallelonga, based on interviews with his father and Shirley, as well as letters his father wrote to his mother. The film is named after The Negro Motorist Green Book, a mid-20th century guide book for African-American travelers written by Victor Hugo Green.

All of us all walk around as if we are sleepwalking. We don’t really experience the world fully, because we arehalf-asleep, doing things we automatically think we have to do. You strip away all that stuff and you focus on the essentials. （我们有如在梦游一般，无法真正全面地体验这个世界是因为我们在半梦游的状态下，行我们自动地认为的“应行之事”，你应该摆脱这些困扰着力在珍重重要的事情上。）

Aging is not just decay, it’s growth. If you’ve found meaning in your life, you’d want to go forward, to see more and do more. （老去并不是逝去，而是成长。如果你找到了生命的意义，你会想继续向前，去见证更多，经历更多）
