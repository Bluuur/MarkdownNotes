+   What do you think are the top 3 factors of happiness: love, money, health, security or family? And why?

What makes a factor of happiness?

The answer to this question is really simple. A happiness factor can be anything that has a significant influence on your happiness.

For me, the top three factors of happiness  are love, family and health. 

To have love is to have someone to rely on, to lessen my pressure and ease my soul. 

Love fulfills our life. Love in marrige, friendship and family are essential. 

Talking about Family, actually family is another factor of happiness. 

With falimy we feel the sense of belonging. 

Family is a place of refuge *['refjudʒ]* from problems and offer a safety network when things go wrong. 

Think about the boost you get when it’s hard to cope with life’s dilemma and you spend time doing something fun with your loved ones. 

I am extremely thankful for having a loving family, and it’s no surprise to me that this is such a big factor for my happiness.

As for health, let's consider it from the other side, being unhealthy. Disease can cause great burden to life. We can't  really say we are happy if we are toubled by disease. I want to state here that I feel really lucky to be in relatively good health.

A person who experiences a severe disability or disease, health can be ranked the first place in the list of happiness factors.

It is obviously very unlikely for you to share the exact same results! The simple truth remains that what makes me happy does not necessarily make you happy as well. Our happiness definition is as unique as we are ourselves!

+   How we behave is who we are. What kind of person do you belong to? Can you use the examples of your behavior to prove that?

Let me tell a story first, and it's actually the daily version of me.

It's Friday afternoon and the clock is ticking. I'm working furiously to complete a task before the five o'clock deadline, while silently cursing myself for not starting it sooner.

I'm the kind of person who like to procrastinate.

I have the habit of delaying an important task, usually by focusing on less urgent, more enjoyable, and easier activities instead.

There is a famous slogan of Nike, "JUST DO IT", and there is also another version for procrastination and I always say it to myself "JUST DO IT  LATER"

To fix my procrastination, I once read a book called $procrastinational\ psychology$, It costed me two months to finish reading it because of procrastination. And then I said to myself "now I konw how to fix my procrastination, and I do will fix it ,  later"

Untill now, I'm still trying to get ride of it.

+   How has the Internet technology changed our relationship with news? Please use your personal experience to illustrate it.

You probably don't stop to think about it often, but technology has dramatically changed the way people access information.

At one time, families gathered around the TV to watch shows together, and before that, they gathered around radios and told stories around the fireplace. 

Throughout the 20th century, the desire for newspapers gradually evolved into radio which then developed into television. Each shift rendered the prior form of media slightly more obsolete and identified a universal theme: that people will always want to obtain news as quickly as possible and will embrace any new technology that permits them to do so. 

The Internet, specifically social media websites and blogs, not only has the ability to deliver information to the public in real time, but the public now expects it.

Due to the advent of the Internet, life has changed. Most people are attached to their computers during the day and receive the bulk of their information from the Internet. Information is available 24 hours in a day, seven days a week and it’s so easy. 

A simple Google search provides hundreds of sources that appear instantly and can provide a wealth of information at your fingertips.

So, yes, Internet technology did change our relationship with news, with Internet technology, we can get news anywhere, anytime.
